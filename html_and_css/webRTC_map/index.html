        Parents always fall for the clammy hands.
        It's physical evidence of illness. It's
        a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are
        generally pretty hip to the fever scams.
        And to make them work you have to go a hundred
        and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous
        mother and you end up in a doctor's office
        and that's worse than school.
